project files for Insight Data Science fellowship

These files are associated with the project IdeaVetter, which was conceptualized as part of the Insight Data Science fellowship.
The project used publicly available Kickstarter data as a proxy for market acceptance of different types of ideas. The project 
used NLP to calculate similarity between input text and past, successful Kickstarter projects to provide users with targeted 
insights about projects that are most similar to theirs. The intention is that the insights will serve as a decision support 
tool, helping users make their own ideas better.
